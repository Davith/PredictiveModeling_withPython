Welcome to the UCI Data Science Initiative's Predictive Modeling with Python course!  This repository contains the iPython Notebooks we'll be using throughout the day.  Here are the steps to get started:

1.  Download and install the [Anaconda Scientific Python Distribution](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/).
2.  Download this repository.  The easiest way is via the 'Download ZIP' button at the bottom of the right-hand column.  Unzip the directory.  
3.  Open a terminal and type ```ipython notebook```.  Navigate to the directory containing this repository.

There are two sets of notebooks.  The ones you see above (in the repository's root) are incomplete, ready to be filled-in by the course's participants.  In the *Solutions* directory, you'll find the completed versions of the aforementioned notebooks.
