Welcome to the UCI Data Science Initiative's Predictive Modeling with Python course!  This repository contains the iPython Notebooks we'll be using throughout the day.  Here are the steps to get started:

1.  Download and install the [Anaconda Scientific Python Distribution](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/).
1.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
1.  Type ```conda update conda``` and press enter or return.  Confirm that you'd like it to make any changes that it offers.
1.  Type ```conda update anaconda``` and press enter or return.  Confirm that you'd like it to make any changes that it offers.
1.  Download this repository.  The easiest way is to download the entire repository as a ZIP file by clicking [here](https://github.com/UCIDataScienceInitiative/PredictiveModeling_withPython/archive/master.zip) or the ```Download ZIP``` button at the bottom of the right-hand column.  Unzip the directory.  
1.  Open a terminal and type ```ipython notebook```.  Navigate to the directory containing this repository.
1.  Open "Test Notebook.ipynb".
1.  Click "Cell" at the top of the opened notebook, followed by "Run All" and ensure that 1) there are no errors and that 2) the output from the first cell is the same as that in the second.  If it doesn't match, raise your hand.
1.  If everything looks good, close the browser tab containing the test notebook but keep open the tab listing all the other notebooks.

There are two sets of notebooks.  The ones you see above (in the repository's root) are incomplete, ready to be filled-in by the course's participants.  In the *Solutions* directory, you'll find the completed versions.
